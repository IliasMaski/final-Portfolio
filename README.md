Typewriting

I was inspired by 'Traversy Media' and a web developer

to load

```html
<script src="js/typewriting.min.js"></script>
```


```html
<h3>Hey, I'm
    <span class="typewrite" data-loop="yes" data-speed="100" data-delay="1000" data-words='["First Word", "Second Word ", "Third word"]'></span>
</h3>
```
